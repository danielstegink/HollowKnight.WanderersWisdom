# Wanderer's Wisdom

This mod adds 2 new charms to the game: 
1. Wanderer's Wisdom, which adds synergies linking your charms and your abilities
2. Wanderer's Guile, which gives you the ability to temporarily survive damage from environmental hazards

Both charms can be acquired from Iselda's Shop after acquiring all of Cornifer's maps, or by using the "Give All Charms" option in DebugMod.
