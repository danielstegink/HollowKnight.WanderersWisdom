# Wanderer's Wisdom
Wanderer's Wisdom creates the following synergies between your abilities and your charms:
1. If you have Mantis Claw, equipping Longnail or Mark of Pride will increase nail damage by 1.
2. If you have Crystal Heart, equipping Quick Focus and Deep Focus will both increase the damage CDash deals by 50%.
3. If you have Monarch Wings, equipping Gathering Swarm or Springmaster will increase your horizontal speed by 20% while airborne.
4. If you have Isma's Tear, then you can get 2 different effects by equipping 2 different charms:
 - If you equip Spore Shroom, the spore cloud will deal 10% more damage.
 - If you equipp Shape of Unn, you will produce a Defender's Crest cloud (colored green) while focusing.
All effects stack, so equiping multiple charms for the same synergy will make it more potent.

# Wanderer's Guile
 - When you take damage from an environmental hazard such as spikes or acid, you will ignore the damage and become invulnerable for 3 seconds.
 - During the 3 seconds of invulernability, you will pulse green 2 times, then yellow 1 time.
 - When the invulnerability expires, you will pulse red for 10 seconds. During this time, you cannot become invulnerable again.
