# Wanderer's Wisdom
Wanderer's Wisdom creates the following synergies between your abilities and your charms:
1. If you have Mantis Claw, equipping Longnail or Mark of Pride will increase nail damage by 1.
2. If you have Crystal Heart, equipping Quick Focus and Deep Focus will both increase the damage CDash deals by 50%.
3. If you have Monarch Wings, equipping Gathering Swarm or Springmaster will increase your horizontal speed by 20% while airborne.
4. If you have Isma's Tear, equipping Spore Shroom will increase spore damage by 10%, and equipping Shape of Unn will create a Defender's Crest cloud while you focus.

All effects stack, so equiping multiple charms for the same synergy will make it more potent.

# Wanderer's Guile
 - When you take damage from an environmental hazard such as spikes or acid, you will ignore the damage and become invulnerable for 3 seconds.
 - During the 3 seconds of invulernability, you will pulse green 2 times, then yellow 1 time.
 - When the invulnerability expires, you will pulse red for 10 seconds. During this time, you cannot become invulnerable again.
