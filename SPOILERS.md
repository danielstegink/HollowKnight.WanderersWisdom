# Wanderer's Guile
 - When you take damage from an environmental hazard such as spikes or acid, you will ignore the damage and become invulnerable for 3 seconds.
 - During the 3 seconds of invulernability, you will pulse green 2 times, then yellow 1 time.
 - When the invulnerability expires, you will pulse red for 10 seconds. During this time, you cannot become invulnerable again.
